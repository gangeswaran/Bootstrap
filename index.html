                Bootstrap, originally developed by Twitter, has evolved into a powerful toolset that enables developers and designers to streamline their workflow and create stunning user interfaces without sacrificing functionality or compatibility. By providing a comprehensive collection of pre-designed components, responsive grid systems, and interactive JavaScript plugins, Bootstrap empowers creators to focus on crafting exceptional user experiences rather than starting from scratch.
